    <h2>CS3220 Lab 8</h2>

    <p>Please deploy your application on CS3, and upload all source files to Canvas. The source files
        should include all the source code, and an HTML file <em>lab8.html</em> which contains a
        hyperlink to your application on the CS3 server.</p>

    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>Please download the file <a href="https://csns.cysun.org/download?fileId=4767429">DrivingTest.txt</a> and
        put it under the <samp>/WEB-INF</samp> folder of your project. This file contains a number of questions
        for a driving test. The format of the file is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Each question occupies five consecutive lines: the first line is the question description, the next three
            lines are three possible answers, and the last line is a number 1, or 2, or 3, which indicates which answer
            is the correct answer.</li>
        <li>The exact number of questions is unknown, but we do know that the questions are separated from one another
            by an empty line.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that you may not change the content of this file.</p>

    <p>For this lab, develop a web application that allows a user to browse the driving test one question at a time. For
        example:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When parking your vehicle parallel to the curb on a level street.<br>
        1. Your front wheels must be turned toward the street.<br>
        2. Your wheels must be within 18 inches of the curb.<br>
        3. One of your rear wheels must touch the curb.<br>
        Correct answer: 2</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">Next</a></p>

    <p>A use may click on the Next link to see the next question, and when the last question is shown, clicking on Next
        should take the user back to the first question. The difficult part of this is to keep track of the index of the
        current question in order to know which question to display when the user clicks Next. There are two acceptable
        approaches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep the index of the current question in session scope, or</li>
        <li>Embed the index of the next question in the Next link as a request parameter, e.g. <code>&lt;a
                href="DrivingTestBrowser?nextQuestionIndex=1"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the same reason as discussed in Lab 6, keeping track of the current question using application scope is
        <em>not</em> an acceptable solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>Your implementation must use the MVC architecture discussed in class. In particular:</p>

    <p>1. (10pt) Create a model class <samp>Question</samp> to hold the information about a question. The class should
        have
        the following properties:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><samp>String</samp> properties of <samp>description</samp>, <samp>answerA</samp>, <samp>answerB</samp>, and
            <samp>answerC</samp>.
        </li>
        <li><samp>int</samp> property <samp>correctAnswer</samp>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. (60pt) Create a controller servlet <code>DrivingTestBrowser</code> as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In <code>init()</code>, read DrivingTest.txt and store the questions in a <code>List&lt;Question&gt;</code>
            in the
            application scope.</li>
        <li>In <code>doGet()</code>, process the request and pass the index of the question to be displayed to a view
            (i.e. JSP).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>HINTS:</p>

    <p>Because the questions are already stored in application scope, you don't need to pass questions to the JSP
        because JSP can access all application scope variables.</p>

    <p>To access a question at a certain index in JSP, you can use something like <code>${questions[index]}</code>
        (assuming the application scope variable for the question list is <code>questions</code>).</p>

    <p>3. (30pt) Create a JSP that displays the question and the <em>Next</em> link using EL.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>In the servlet you can get the path to the file <samp>DrivingTest.txt</samp> using
        <code>getServletContext().getRealPath("/WEB-INF/DrivingTest.txt")</code>,
        and this file should also be uploaded to CS3 when you deploy your application.
    </p>

    <p>There are two common ways to read a text file in Java:</p>

    <p>a) Using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Scanner</a>. For
        example:</p>

    <pre>
        Scanner in = new Scanner(new File(filename));
        while( in.hasNextLine() )
            System.out.println(in.nextLine());
        in.close();</pre>

    <p>b) Using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html">BufferedReader</a>. For
        example:</p>

    <pre>
        BufferedReader in = new
        BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filename)));
        String line;
        while( (line = in.readLine()) != null )
            System.out.println(line);
        in.close();</pre>
