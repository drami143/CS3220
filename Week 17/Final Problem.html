    <title>CS3220 Final</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Please deploy your application on CS3, and package your project in a zip
        file and submit it to Canvas. The source files should include all the
        source code, and an HTML file <em>final.html</em> which contains a
        hyperlink to your application on the CS3 server.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In this exam you are going to develop a review manager web application that is similar to the ones that can be
        found on many smart phones.</p>

    <p>Your application must use a database to store the data, and you must submit an SQL script file
        <em>final.sql</em> which contains the statements to create and populate all the tables for the
        application. Your implementation must follow the MVC architecture and use JDBC for database access.
        For simplicity, we assume that all user input are correct so you do not need to do input validation.
    </p>

    <p>The main page of the application displays the names of the attractions managed by the application.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <h3>Attractions</h3>

        <p><a href="#">Add An Attraction</a></p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
            <thead>
			<tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
					<th>Phone</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="#">Disneyland Park</a></td>
                    <td>(234) 567-8901</td>
                </tr>
				<tr>
                    <td><a href="#">Six Flags Park</a></td>
					<td>(567) 890-1234</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="#">Universal Studios Hollywood</a></td>
                    <td>(345) 678-9012</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the attractions are listed in alphabetic order. For simplicity you may
        assume that attraction names are unique.</p>

    <p>A user may click on <em>Add An Attraction</em> to add a new attraction. For example:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <h3><a href="#">Attractions</a> - Add An Attraction</h3>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Attraction Name:</th>
                    <td><input name="name" type="text" /></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Phone Number:</th>
                    <td><input name="phone" type="text" /></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: right;">
                        <input name="add" type="submit" value="Add" />
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>After an attraction is added, the user should be redirected to the attractions list page. Clicking on <em>Attractions</em>
        also takes the user back to the attraction list page.</p>

    <p>Clicking on the name of an attraction in the attractions list allows the user to see all the reviews about the
        attraction as well as adding more reviews to the attraction:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <h3><a href="#">Attractions</a> - Disneyland Park</h3>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Reviewer Name</th>
					<th>Review</th>
                    
                    <td>&nbsp;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>John</td>
                    <td>Lots of fun for all ages</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><input name="field" type="text" /></td>
					<td><textarea name="value" ></textarea></td>
                    <td><input name="add" type="submit" value="Add" /></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that after a new review is added, the user should be redirected back to the attractions page,
        and there is no limit on how many reviews a user can add to an attraction.</p>
